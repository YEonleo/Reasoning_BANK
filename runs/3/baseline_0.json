It gives each locomotive’s identifying number, operating status, and the name of the daily excursion it heads, if operational. What are the odds that today’s Sunset Picnic Trip will use a steam locomotive? Assume that each day’s excursion picks one of its assigned locomotives at random, and express the answer in the form “1 in 4”, “1 in 5”, etc.",
